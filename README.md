# Util commands
Some util linux commands.
	-newproject <project_name>:
		This command creates a repo with the specified name using
		github api and it creates the corresponding project folder 
		in your file system. Additionally it opens VS Code in that 
		specific folder.
	-delproject <project_name>:
		The opposite to newproject

I'll be adding more commands
